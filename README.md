# Agenda
First time in here, I am building this in order to create apps, and then make them active.
What Kind of apps?
-Apps that focus on social issues, social structures, and social programming.
How?
-By enforcing students like me, or any ohter, to start working on programming and other abstract tool of engineering.
Example.
-A diary of direct actions, personal trainer or selective one. What can you guide others ina week or more.
